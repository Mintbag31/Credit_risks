Credit Risk Classification with Decision Trees and Random Forest

This project implements machine learning models to predict customer credit risk using financial data.

To run this project:

    Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/Mintbag31/Credit_risks.git
    cd Credit_risks

    Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Download the dataset (CreditScoring.csv) and place it in the project folder

    Open and run the notebook:
    jupyter notebook chapter_6_credit_risks.ipynb

The project compares Decision Trees and Random Forest classifiers for credit default prediction, with the Random Forest model achieving the best performance.
